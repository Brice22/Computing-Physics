Applying the Bisection Method in Solving Polynomial Equation with Jupyter Lab
In most of real-life situations, the polynomial equation cannot be 
solved analytically. One of the alternative ways is to find the solution 
using numerical analysis. I will use Jupyter Lab & Python 
to program and carry out the numerical analysis in approximating the 
solution of a polynomial equation.  I used numpy to plot functions and Pandas for data analysis.
By applying Intermediate Value Theorem several times in a nested interval, one 
can find an approximate answer of the zero of a function.
